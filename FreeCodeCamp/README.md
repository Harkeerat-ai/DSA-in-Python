# DSA-in-Python
This repository documents and implements what has been learnt while following the “Data Structures and Algorithms in Python – Full Course for Beginners” by Aakash N S (Jovian) on freeCodeCamp.org. It serves as a personal reference, practice hub, and progression log for core data structures, algorithms, and interview-style problem solving in Python.
​

Overview
Covers the complete course roadmap: binary search, linked lists, complexity analysis, trees, hash tables, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.
​

Organized by lessons, assignments, and project so it mirrors the course flow and shows how concepts were learned and then applied.
​

What this repo includes
Implementations of data structures: linked lists, binary trees, binary search trees, hash tables, stacks, queues, and graph representations.
​

Implementations of key algorithms: linear and binary search, classic sorting methods, BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms, and dynamic programming patterns like knapsack.
​

Learning focus
Emphasis on understanding time and space complexity using Big O notation and comparing approaches such as linear vs binary search or different sorting strategies.
​

Step‑by‑step problem solving using the Jovian problem‑solving template: write the approach in plain English, then translate it into clean Python code.
​

Course-linked sections
Lesson-wise folders following the YouTube course chapters, including binary search & linked lists, BSTs & recursion, hash tables & dictionaries, sorting & divide and conquer, recursion & DP, and graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, shortest paths).
​

An interview prep section inspired by Lesson 6 with Python interview questions, coding exercises (e.g., subarray sum, minimum edit distance), and personal notes on patterns and strategies.
